bootcamp
========
Bootcamp aims to solve the problem of spaghetti code and lack of structure in small-medium scale javascript apps. Not every project needs to scale to a million users. However the setups used by large scale javascript app frameworks can also benefit small-medium scale apps. Bootcamp is a starter kit that tries to use the good parts of the setup of these large scale apps so that even your small-medium scale apps have some structure without having to build everything ground-up.

As the project evolves, more libraries might be added and existing libraries will be integrated to provide more functionality.

Bundled Frameworks.
------------------

- HTML 5 Modernizer
- jQuery 
- underscorejs
- jQueryUI
- requirejs
- Twitter bootstrap.
- underscorejs
- backbonejs
- marionettejs

All the libraries are included using requirejs configuration in js/main.js allowing you use any of them at will.
